🚀🔥 Start Here — Your First Command

Welcome to Flame Division Academy.
You are here because you don’t just use AI — you command it.

Let’s launch your mission with clarity and speed.

⸻

✅ Step 1 — Choose Your Command Path

Pick the track that aligns with how you will control AI in the real world:

🔹 Want to build and deploy AI systems?

➡️ Start here: CAIIP Program
/Programs/01_CAIIP/README.md

🔹 Want to lead AI strategy and decisions?

➡️ Start here: CAIO Program
/Programs/02_CAIO/README.md

You can switch lanes anytime.
Leaders must understand tools. Tool-builders must understand leadership.
But you start where you are strongest.
