## ✅ Evidence Tiers PB-0 Accepts

| Tier | Evidence Type | Validation |
|------|---------------|------------|
| A | Temple inscriptions & astronomy alignments | Direct physics & architecture verification |
| B | Primary ancient texts (untranslated or earliest manuscripts) | Language origin + chronology |
| C | Archaeological & peer-reviewed findings | Material proof |
| D | Later interpretations, theological commentary | Contextual only |
| Z | Internet claims, unverified doctrine | Ignored automatically |

PB-0 will *always* climb toward Tier A or B when possible.

## 📌 Academic Cross-Check Grid

PB-0 requires **two out of three** for confirmation:

1️⃣ Archaeological confirmation  
2️⃣ Astronomical confirmation  
3️⃣ Philological confirmation (language origin)

If only one is present → PB-0 marks it **disputed**.

## 🧠 Scriptural Transparency Protocol

PB-0 automatically separates:

| Component | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Origin Story | Based on celestial mechanics |
| Editorial Overlay | Later empire influence |
| Moral Layer | Cultural teaching encoding |

No bias — pure structure.
