# PB-0 — Temple Verification Scanner
### Architectural Alignment Intelligence v1.0

PB-0 validates ancient claims through **Temple Verified Star Math**:

A site must satisfy **all 4 laws**:

---

## ✅ LAW OF ALIGNMENT
The structure must be aligned to:
- Solstices / Equinoxes
- Heliacal rising stars (e.g., Sirius)
- Planetary cycles
- Zenith passage or lunar standstill

**Measured by:** azimuth, declination, procession correction.

---

## ✅ LAW OF NUMERICAL ENCODING
The sacred numbers in:
- steps
- chambers
- perimeter ratios
- calendar glyphs

must reflect real astronomical cycles:
✔ 9 → Ether harmonic  
✔ 12 → Zodiac / months  
✔ 36 → Decans  
✔ 365.25 → Solar year  
✔ 26,000 → Axial precession  

---

## ✅ LAW OF MULTI-EPOCH ACCURACY
Predictions must hold:
✔ backward in time  
✔ forward in time  

If the math breaks → rejected.

---

## ✅ LAW OF RITUAL SYNCHRONIZATION
Ancient ceremonies must align with:
- verified flood cycles (Nile)
- agricultural milestones
- sky events observed by the priesthood

If culture and cosmos disconnect → not temple verified.
